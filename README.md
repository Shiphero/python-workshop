# python-workshop
A crash course for future pythonistas


## Introduction

At Shiphero. We use Python as one of our main technologies. It’s a powerful and pragmatic programming language that shines when you understand its way of doing, the so-called “pythonic” design and code. 

We want to give this “workshop” (in the sense that it could mutate on its way, driven by the questions or interests that arise) as an introduction to give new developers the fundamental concepts, techniques and tools to become a good python programmer, sowing the skills to continue learning on its own.

- Comprehensions
- Packing/Unpacking, indexing, slicing. Mutability, sequences. 

#### Lesson 02

- `Zip()` function.

- dictionaries, sets. defaultdic

#### Lesson 03

- Function definitions. Positional and keyword arguments. Flexible arguments. Keyword only.
- Namespaces.

#### Lesson 04

- Typing. Python annotations: type hints. 
- Generators.
- Few useful builtin: zip, range, enumerate, sorted 
- Exception handling.

#### Lesson 05
